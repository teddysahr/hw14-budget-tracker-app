# hw14-budget-tracker-app

## Discription
This is an app that allows users to keep track of all their expenses. You can add funds or subtract purchases by dollar amount and each entry gives the user an input to add a description. This app works offline as well.

## Usage
Simply enter what you would like to be logged ("paycheck," "groceries," "rent," etc.). Then enter a dollar amount and choose whether you would like to add or subtract it. The graph will reflect the overall funds over time.
